# shopping_list

In this project, I am building a real-time shopping list using AWS Amplify. amplify allows us to leverage AWS services like Cognito, AppSync, and DynamoDB without all the complicated setup. On top of that, Amplify even handles the code generation for the GraphQL API I will be building.
